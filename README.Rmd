# arkdb

The goal of arkdb is to provide a convienent way to move data from large compressed text files (tsv, csv, etc) into any DBI-compliant database connection (e.g. MYSQL, Postgres, SQLite; see [DBI](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/)), and move tables out of such databases into text files. The key feature of arkdb is that files are moved between databases and text files in chunks of a fixed size, allowing the package functions to work with tables that would be much to large to read into memory all at once.  

## Links

- A more detailed introduction to package design and use can be found in the package [Vignette](https://ropensci.github.io/arkdb/articles/arkdb_intro.html)
- [Online versions of package documentation](https://ropensci.github.io/arkdb)

## Installation

You can install arkdb from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cboettig/arkdb")
```


# Basic use

```{r message = FALSE}
library(arkdb)

# additional libraries just for this demo
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(fs)
```

## Creating an archive of a database

Consider the `nycflights` database in SQLite:

```{r example}
tmp <- tempdir() # Or can be your working directory, "."
db <- dbplyr::nycflights13_sqlite(tmp)
```

Create an archive of the database: 

```{r}
dir <- fs::dir_create(fs::path(tmp, "nycflights"))
ark(db, dir, lines = 50000)
```

## Unarchive

Import a list of compressed tabular files (i.e. `*.csv.bz2`) into a local SQLite database:


```{r}
files <- fs::dir_ls(dir)
new_db <- src_sqlite(fs::path(tmp, "local.sqlite"), create=TRUE)

unark(files, new_db, lines = 50000)

new_db
```



```{r include=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db$con)
DBI::dbDisconnect(new_db$con)

codemetar::write_codemeta()
```
