The goal of `arkdb` is to provide a convenient way to move data from large compressed text files (tsv, csv, etc) into any DBI-compliant database connection (e.g. MYSQL, Postgres, SQLite; see [DBI](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/)), and move tables out of such databases into text files. The key feature of `arkdb` is that files are moved between databases and text files in chunks of a fixed size, allowing the package functions to work with tables that would be much too large to read into memory all at once.    

## Links

- A more detailed introduction to package design and use can be found in the package [Vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/arkdb/articles/arkdb.html)
- [Online versions of package documentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/arkdb/)

## Installation

You can install arkdb from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cboettig/arkdb")
```


# Basic use

```{r message = FALSE}
library(arkdb)

# additional libraries just for this demo
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(fs)
```

## Creating an archive of a database

Consider the `nycflights` database in SQLite:

```{r example}
tmp <- tempdir() # Or can be your working directory, "."
db <- dbplyr::nycflights13_sqlite(tmp)
```

Create an archive of the database: 

```{r}
dir <- fs::dir_create(fs::path(tmp, "nycflights"))
ark(db, dir, lines = 50000)
```

## Unarchive

Import a list of compressed tabular files (i.e. `*.csv.bz2`) into a local SQLite database:


```{r}
files <- fs::dir_ls(dir)
new_db <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), fs::path(tmp, "local.sqlite"))

unark(files, new_db, lines = 50000)
```



```{r include=FALSE}


disconnect <- function(db){
  ## Cleanup 
  if(inherits(db, "DBIConnection")){
    DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
  } else {
    DBI::dbDisconnect(db$con)
  }
}

DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
DBI::dbDisconnect(new_db)

codemetar::write_codemeta()
```

# Output Formats and Custom Read and Write

The `arkdb` package is easily extended to use custom read and write methods allowing you to dictate your own output formats. See `R/streamable_table.R` for examples that include using: 

- Base c/tsv
- Apache arrow's parquet
- The `readr` package for c/tsv
